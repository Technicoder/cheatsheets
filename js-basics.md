# JavaScript Basics

## Usage and version

### ES6

The last and most complete JavaScript version is called **ES6**, short for _ECMAScript Edition 6_, sometimes referred as ES2015.

It was published in June 2015 and modern browsers implement 95%+ of it.

### Node.js

**Node.js** is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment for executing JavaScript code server-side.

```bash
node foo.js # Will execute the JS code inside `foo.js` (think `ruby foo.rb`)
```

```bash
node        # Gives a REPL to execute JS code
>
# Ctrl-C twice to exit
```
